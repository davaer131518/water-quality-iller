 # Iller River Water Quality Forecasting
This project focuses on developing a robust forecasting model to predict future water quality of the Iller River in Kempten. Our solution encompasses the following key components:

* End-to-End Reproducible Data Collection Pipeline: We built a comprehensive pipeline to automate the collection of water data. This pipeline ensures consistent and reliable data acquisition for future predictions.
* Data Integration and Formatting: We merged and appropriately formatted data from various sources, including both our collected data and externally provided datasets, to create a cohesive dataset suitable for modeling.
* Time-Series Forecasting Model: Leveraging the Facebook Prophet model, we implemented a time-series forecasting approach to accurately predict future water quality trends of the Iller River. Prophet's ability to handle seasonality and trend components made it a perfect fit for our requirements.
